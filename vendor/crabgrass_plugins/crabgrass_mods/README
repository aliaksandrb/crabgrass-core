This plugin that allows other plugins to change the core
code of the application. We call these plugins 'mods'.

Different ways of modifying a rails app:

(1) plugins provide new code that can be optionally called
    by the application.

(2) engines are plugins that can also add entire mini-apps
    to a rails application. Most of the functionality of 
    engines is now part of rails 2.3.

(3) mods are different: they are plugins that only work
    for a particular rails application. they work by modifying
    the behavior of the specific classes of the application.

EXAMPLE
----------------------------------

Core application model:

  class Crow < ActiveRecord::Base
    def make_sound
      'caw'
    end
    acts_as_extensible
  end

A mod's init.rb:

  extend_model :Crow do
    has_many :feathers
    def feather_color
      'black'
    end
    def make_sound
      'squawk'
    end
  end

OPTIONS
-------------------------------------

class X
  def self.load_plugin?(path)
    true
  end
end

Mods.plugin_enabled_callback = X.method(:load_plugin?)
