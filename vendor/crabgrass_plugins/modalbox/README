Usage:

  to be written

Modalbox event listeners:

	* beforeLoad — fires right before loading contents into the ModalBox. If the callback function returns false, content loading will skipped. This can be used for redirecting user to another MB-page for authorization purposes for example.

	* afterLoad — fires after loading content into the ModalBox (i.e. after showing or updating existing window).

	* beforeHide — fires right before removing elements from the DOM. Might be useful to get form values before hiding modalbox.

	* afterHide — fires after hiding ModalBox from the screen.

	* afterResize — fires after calling resize method.

	* onShow — fires on first appearing of ModalBox before the contents are being loaded.

	* onUpdate — fires on updating the content of ModalBox (on call of Modalbox.show method from active ModalBox instance).

Ajax request event listeners:

	* onComplete -- called when ajax request finishes
	* onLoading  -- called when ajax request starts loading
	* onSuccess  -- called when ajax request returns success
