CRABGRASS HACKS TO PLUGINS
===============================

Before upgrading a plugin, check here to see if there are
special crabgrass hacks have been applied.

acts_as_rateable: allow a rating of nil. Also, the plugin's
rating.rb is overridden by app/models/rating.rb. 

acts_as_tree: hack to to allow whatever options you pass to
acts_as_tree to be passed on to the has_many :children
association that acts_as_tree creates.

minimagic: renamed minimagic to be aa_pseudo_rmagick and
changed the code to use gm (graphicmagick) instead of
imagemagic.


What do these do?
========================================

these are undocumented:
  database_cleaner
  inheritable_templates
  optional_haml
  partioprint
  pickle
  rails_indexes
  ya2yaml

PLUGINS
==========================================================

Core Plugins
------------

routing_filter
  http://github.com/svenfuchs/routing-filter/tree/master
  allows you to wrap a black box around the rails routing code to modify the
  behavior as you see fit. fun and powerful!  

ActiveRecord Plugins
--------------------

acts_as_rateable
  Adds ratings to activerecords. Used to rate comments.
  Not maintained in 4 years. There's a gem but its init file
  is not compatible with rails 3.
  There are forks on github that fix this but they also apply
  other changes in particular they change the database structure
  possible next steps:
  * fork on github and cherry pick from other repos
  * use letsrate instead https://github.com/muratguzel/letsrate
  * include as lib in crabgrass
  
better_acts_as_tree
  A slightly modified version of standard acts as tree. 
  This modification allows association callbacks. 

acts_as_versioned
  used to do wiki versioning.

will_paginate
  Adds paginate() to activerecord. 

ActionController Plugins
-------------------------

before_render
  Adds a new callback filter that can be called after the controller action is
  run and before the view starts to get generated. Very useful!
  http://github.com/xtoddx/before_render/tree/master

http_accept_language
  does a good job of cleaning up the info the browser sends us regarding
  what language the user prefers.

Media Plugins
-------------

fleximage
  no longer used
  used for avatars. We use the plugin and not the gem because the gem has
  RMagick as a dependency.
