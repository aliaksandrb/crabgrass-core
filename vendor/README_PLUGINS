CRABGRASS HACKS TO PLUGINS
===============================

Before upgrading a plugin, check here to see if there are
special crabgrass hacks have been applied.

acts_as_rateable: allow a rating of nil. Also, the plugin's
rating.rb is overridden by app/models/rating.rb. 

acts_as_tree: hack to to allow whatever options you pass to
acts_as_tree to be passed on to the has_many :children
association that acts_as_tree creates.

minimagic: renamed minimagic to be aa_pseudo_rmagick and
changed the code to use gm (graphicmagick) instead of
imagemagic.


What do these do?
========================================

these are undocumented:
  database_cleaner
  inheritable_templates
  optional_haml
  partioprint
  pickle
  rails_indexes
  ya2yaml
