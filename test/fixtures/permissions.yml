# == Permissions
# 
#
# As we use permissions for access rights on groups we need some
# self-referential permissions for all groups. If they do not have a
# council their permission mask is ~0 - so all true.
# If they do have a council they may not admin the group themselves 
# anymore so it is ~4 (:admin being the 3rd bit permission)
