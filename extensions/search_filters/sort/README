# few columns have indexes on them, either for mysql or sphinx, so
# sorting should be used with caution.
#
# mysql indexes:
#   type, flow, created_at, updated_at, name.
#
# sphinx indexes:
#   title, created_by_login, updated_by_login, owner_name, page_created_at,
#   page_updated_at, created_by_id, updated_by_id, views_count, stars_count.
