Internet explorer poses something of a problem. IE sends to the webserver
this for its accept header:

  "image/jpeg, application/x-ms-application, image/gif, application/xaml+xml, image/pjpeg, application/x-ms-xbap, */*"

There are a couple consequences of this if the browser is IE:

(1) request.format is useless. It will be image/jpeg even for html requests.

(2) if you do respond_to() {format.xml{'x'}; format.html {'x'}} then
    the xml will ALWAYS be returned because it is first in the accepts
    (higher priority than '*/*')

There is an interesting workaround here:

This order is important. It means if you want to send HTML, This will cause request.format to be 'image/jpeg'.
