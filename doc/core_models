A 'page' is the basic model for all content in crabgrass. examples are a wiki page, an uploaded file/image/audio/video, a poll, a task list.

these specific page types are subclasses of Page and they have their own controller and views. In effect, every page is its own rails application.

the page controller is subclass from BasePageController. it defines a particular api of variables to set, callbacks to hook into, methods to implement, or methods to override.

all pages are actually implemented as plugins, but plugins that live in a special folder called 'extensions/pages'

Discussions and Posts
=====================

class Discussion
  has_many :posts
end

class Posts
  belongs_to :discussion
  belongs_to :user
end
