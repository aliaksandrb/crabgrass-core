these still need a place:
===================================

AssetExtension::Storage.make_required_dirs

THINGS TO CONFIGURE
==================================

There are three files that need to be configured for crabgrass:

  * config/crabgrass/secret.txt  (rake make_a_secret)
  * config/database.yml
  * config/crabgrass/crabgrass.[production|development|test].yml

There are many levels of possible defaults for configuration options.
In order of precedence, crabgrass will search:

   (1) the current site
   (2) the default site (if a site has default == true)
   (3) options configured in the file config/crabgrass.*.yml
   (4) last-stop hardcoded defaults in lib/crabgrass/conf.rb
