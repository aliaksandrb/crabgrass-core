In development mode:

  config/locales/en/*.yml is used.

In production mode:

  config/locales/en.yml is used.

Run this to generate en.yml:

  rake cg:i18n:bundle

For speed in dev mode, remember to run BOOST=1 radically speed up request time
by skipping the loading of the i18n files on each request.
