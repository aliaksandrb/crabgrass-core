mailing list integration
=============================

two main problems: 

  (1) queuing and processing incoming messages
  (2) queuing outgoing messages

for incoming:

  Mailman (no, not that mailman, a ruby mailman)
  http://github.com/titanous/mailman
  http://rubydoc.info/github/titanous/mailman/master/file/USER_GUIDE.md
  point it at a maildir, and build easy routes based on conditions in the messages.

for outgoing:

  ARMailer: http://seattlerb.rubyforge.org/ar_mailer/
  ActionMailer::Queue: http://github.com/beam/action-mailer-queue/

  I think both do two phase delivery: when you send, it queues to db, then a bg process
  reads the queue and delivers the messages.

for background processing:

  starling for bg email processing: http://railscasts.com/episodes/128-starling-and-workling
  bj: http://codeforpeople.rubyforge.org/svn/bj/trunk/README

address formats:

  cgdev@we.riseup.net
  - new subject: create new discussion page in cgdev
  - old subject: append comment to existing page in cgdev

  cgdev+ui@we.riseup.net (for committees)

  cgdev+ui+70984@we.riseup.net
  - encode the page id in the return address. this way, we won't have problems parsing the subject. will this conflict with committee names? can committee names be just numbers?

requests
============================================

the queries that we seem to do the most for requests are slow with how the schema for requests works.

in particular, i think we might be doing a lot of queries for all the requests that relate to a given person or group, either as a creator or a recipient. the problem is that this requires a slow OR conditions, or a UNION.

it would make more sense to give requests just a column for user and a column for people, then use some other method to determine who the creator and recipient are...
