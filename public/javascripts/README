There are two kinds of javascript files:

  (1) bundled: bundled scripts get joined together and compressed when running
      in production mode. They are referred to by symbol, rather than by filename.

      There are currently three bundles:

      a) main: always loaded for every request
      b) extra: a bundle of fancy effects, like drag and drop.
      c) wiki: all the stuff needed for editing wikis

  (2) as needed: these are loaded on a per controller (and per action) basis,
      using the 'javascript' method.

The optional scripts are loaded like so:

  class MyController < ApplicationController
    javascript :tasks, :wiki
    javascript :extra, :action => :index
  end

The script bundles are defined by constants in layout_helper.rb:

  MAIN_JS = ['prototype', 'application', 'modalbox', 'effects', 'controls', 'autocomplete']
  EXTRA_JS = ['dragdrop', 'builder', 'slider']
  WIKI_JS = ['wiki/textile_editor', 'wiki/nicEdit.js', 'wiki/wiki_tabs']

The order determines what order the files are loaded in.

If you modify any of these files, make sure to run this command:

  rake minify

This will generate main.js.gz and extra.js.gz, etc. These are minified and compressed combinations of all
the javascript files defined by MAIN_JS and EXTRA_JS.

In order to use these file correctly, you should configure apache like so:

  AddEncoding gzip .gz
  RewriteCond %{HTTP:Accept-encoding} gzip
  RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} !Safari
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}.gz -f
  RewriteRule ^(.*)$ $1.gz [QSA,L]

More details can be found in the minify.rb file. In order to run minify, you must have java installed.
