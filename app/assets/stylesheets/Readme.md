Asset Pipeline Stylesheets
==========================


These stylesheets will be compiled and handed out via the asset pipeline.

They are mostly helper stylesheets. The real magic happens in app/stylesheets.
The stylesheets there are processed with our own theme processing. So they
can include config options set in themes.
