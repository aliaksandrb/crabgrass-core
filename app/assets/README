Javascripts
==============================================

Javascript are served using the Sprockets gem for asset pipelining.

About these scripts
----------------------------------------------

app/javascripts/libraries/history.js

  A library to make HTML5 window.history work better, and also fallback
  gracefully for HTML4 browsers. It is a little heavyweight, and includes
  a bunch of features we don't need -- like storing data with history.

app/javascripts/prototype.js

  core additions to javascript. included in prototype directory are the
  scriptaculous effects for prototype that we also use.


Using scripts
----------------------------------------------

We currently load all scripts on all pages (e.g. there is nothing in
as_needed). If you want an 'as_needed' script that is only loaded for a
particular controller:

  class MyController < ApplicationController
    javascript :tasks, :wiki
    javascript :extra, :action => :index
  end


Stylesheets
==============================================

Most stylesheets are in app/stylesheets and are generated different
for each theme.

However, stylesheets in app/assets/stylesheets will be compiled and
will use the normal rails asset pipeline.
