A library to make HTML5 window.history work better, and also fallback
gracefully for HTML4 browsers.

  https://github.com/balupton/History.js/

It is a little heavyweight, and includes a bunch of features we don't
need -- like storing data with history. For this reason, I created
json2-dummy.js, which tricks history.js into not storing data.

To update the source files in this directory:

  cd app/assets/javascripts/libraries/history
  curl https://nodeload.github.com/balupton/History.js/tarball/master | tar -vxz --transform 's/.*\/scripts\/uncompressed\///' --overwrite --wildcards '*/uncompressed/*.js'
  rm history.adapter.jquery.js
  rm history.adapter.mootools.js
  rm history.adapter.right.js
  rm history.adapter.zepto.js

There are two options we have for history.js support: html5 only or html5+html4.

For html5 only support, bundle these files:

  history/history.adapter.native.js
  history/history.js

For html4+html5 support, bundle these files (in this order):

  history/json2.js
  history/history.adapter.native.js
  history/history.html4.js
  history/history.js

See https://github.com/balupton/history.js/blob/master/buildr.coffee for the build rules.

NOTE: if/when we switch to jquery, replace native adapter with jquery adaptor.
