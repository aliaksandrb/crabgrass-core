// SHY LINKS
//

// these are links or elements that should not be visible until you hover over a parent
// element. the problem with display:none is that it removes the element from the layout
// and then making it visible again can lead to weird jerkiness. so, instead, we use opacity
// for this. It seems to work in all browsers.
