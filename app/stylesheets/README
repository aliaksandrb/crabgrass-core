Stylesheets
===========================

screen.scss -- main application stylesheet
bootstrap/  -- twitter bootstrap converted to SCSS.

Themes and stylesheets
===========================

All the variables defined in a theme are made available to screen.scss.

This is done by auto-generating a SCSS file for each theme that looks like this:

    // VARIABLES FROM extensions/themes/blueberry
    $masthead_style: "full";
    $posts_border: 1px solid #ddd;
    $local_sidecolumn_width: 7;
    $color_dim: #999;
    ...
    // FILE FROM app/stylesheets/screen.scss
    <contents of screen.scss>

Every theme has a different URL for it's screen.scss. For example, the theme
"blueberry" uses this URL:

    /theme/blueberry/screen.css
