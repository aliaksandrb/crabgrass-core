Eventually, we want to migrate more of the CSS over to using "Bootstrap"

  http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap

In this directories is a copy of bootstrap converted to SCSS:

  https://github.com/jlong/sass-twitter-bootstrap

To update these bootstrap files, copy the files from lib/*.scss of that repo to this directory.
