Eventually, we want to migrate more of the CSS over to using "Bootstrap"

  http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap

In this directories is a copy of bootstrap converted to SCSS:

  https://github.com/jlong/sass-twitter-bootstrap

To update the files in this directory, run this command (in this directory!)

  curl https://nodeload.github.com/jlong/sass-twitter-bootstrap/tarball/master | tar -vxz --transform 's/.*lib\///' --overwrite --wildcards '*/lib/*.scss'
