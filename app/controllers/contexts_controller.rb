# We have shortcut urls to users and all kinds of groups. These are nice but we need to
# destinguish between the two different Controllers used for groups and people somewhere.
# DispatchController to the rescue.
#
# This Controller handles routes of the form /:context_id
# :context_id can be a group name or user login
# It will try to find the corresponding group or user and load their controller.
