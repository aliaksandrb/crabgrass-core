# Permissions
#
# Helpers and Controller code for handling permissions.
#
# There are four parts to the crabgrass permission system:
#
# (1) permission definition modules in app/permissions.
# (2) controllers specify which permission modules to include.
# (3) access is restricted to controller's actions, either by...
#     (a) manually guarding some actions
#     (b) defining the authorized?() method.
#     (c) using permission auto-guessing.
# (4) views use permission definitions in order to display the right thing
#
#
# (1) Permission Definition
# ---------------------------------
#
# A 'permission' is just a method available to controllers and views
# that returns true or false.
#
# Most permission methods have a standard form:
#
#  def may_{verb}_{object}?
#    ...
#  end
#
# This form is not required, but is highly recommended in most cases.
#
# When attempting to match the current request to the appropriate permission,
# method, params[:action] is the default verb and params[:controller] is the
# default object.
#
# In other words, if the request is 'update' on controller 'robots', then by
# by default we will call 'may_update_robot?' ("robots" gets singularized just
# like in resource paths). These defaults can be changed (see below).
#
# A permission method should return true or false. It may take optional arguments,
# but no arguments should be required.
#
# (2) Controllers include permissions
# -------------------------------------------
#
# class RobotsController < Common::Application
#   permissions :robots
# end
#
# This will load /app/permissions/robots_permissions.rb
#
# You can alter the default verb or object with guard_like:
#
#   guard_like 'cyborgs'
#
# NOTE: guard and guard_like settings will NOT be inherited by subclasses.
#
# You can also do this dynamically by defining the methods permission_verb or
# permission_object:
#
#   def permission_object
#     half_human? ? :cyborgs : :robots
#   end
#
# (3) Restricting access to actions
# -------------------------------------------------
#
# There are three ways to apply a permission to a controller action:
#
#   (a) manually guarding actions
#   (b) define the authorized?() method
#   (c) use permission auto-guessing
#
# (a) manually guarding actions
#
#   At the top of your controller definition, do this:
#
#     guard :show => :may_show_robots?,
#           :update => :may_edit_robots?  #
#   This will ensure the may_show_robots? returns true before 'show()' will run.
#   Procs are also allowed, as well as the special symbol :allow. For example
#
#     guard :show => Proc.new { @robot.is_hungry? },
#           :update => :allow
#
# (b) define the authorized?() method
#
#   In your controller, you can define this protected method:
#
#     def authorized?
#       if params[:action] == 'update' and @robot.sleeping?
#         may_update_robot?
#       else
#         false
#       end
#     end
#
#   Basically, if authorized?() returns false, the user will get a permission
#   denied message.
#
#   NOTE: The 'authorized?' before filter is called from the
#         :login_required before filter or needs to be added to the controller.
#         This should change eventually.
#
# (c) permission auto-guessing
#
#   Common::Application has this default definition of authorized?()
#
#     def authorized?
#       check_permissions!
#     end
#
#   This will attempt to find a permission method that corresponds to the current
#   verb and object. If none are found, then it returns true. If a permission method
#   is found and the test passes, then check_permissions! returns true. If the test
#   failed, then a PermissionDenied exception is raised.
#
#
# (4) Permissions in views
# ------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The permission methods can be called anywhere. It is useful to call them
# before displaying a link, because you don't want to link to something that
# the user is not allowed to do.
#

#
# DEV NOTE:
# The code here relies on this:
#   class Common::Application
#     def controller(); self; end
#   end
# ...and will not work without it.
#

    # and related views.
