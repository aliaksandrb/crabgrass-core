Description:
    Create a new pagetype to use in crabgrass.
    Running this generator will enable the creation of pages of a new type
    inside crabgrass:
    * Click on "Create New Page" in the 'me' menu.
    * Pick the new pagetype - probably last in the selection
    * fill in the fields for the page and create the page
    This will create a page of the new pagetype. Of course the specific
    functionality still needs to be added.

Example:
    rails generate pagetype bird

    This will create:
        extensions/pages/bird_page
    and preseed it with an engine, model and controller for the pagetype.

    Inside the engine definition it will register the pagetype with
    crabgrass and activate it in
      config/crabgrass/crabgrass.development.yml
    so it can be played with.

    A dummy pagetype description will be added to
      config/locales/en/pages.yml
